### Announcement to Linux Users ###
The Linux port is currently unmaintained and thus out-dated. It may work incorrectly, or even fail to compile completely.

A workaround is to use the Win32 build under WINE (reported working) or something similar.

We are sorry for the inconvenience, and any help to fix the Linux port is appreciated.
